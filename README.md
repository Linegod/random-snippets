random snippets of code

I should really commit more.

### snmp_oid_collect.sh

This script does a bulkwalk of a snmp table

and turns the output into a key-value pair, suitable for ingestion into Splunk

### split_json.sh

Converts ${INPUT} into single line objects,

then splits on a given size.   Then uses --filter to

place each split back into an array an outputs to 

given filename
